# Rustle Lang

This is a little toy language I built out to familiarize myself with the process of lexing, parsing, and interpreting. It hews pretty closely to Robert Nystrom's Lox language; I followed the lessons taught in his Crafting Interpreters book (thanks Bob, if you ever read this!) and adapted it to Rust as best I could. I wanted to give myself a challenge to try to grow my Rust expertise - the ownership/lifetime problem in a language parsing setting seemed like a unique exercise - and I learned a lot and definitely had fun putting all the pieces together. That said, there's plenty of room for improvement: I'm sure I can resolve my (admittedly) somewhat liberal use of cloning, and I'd be curious to look into I/O implementation and different logging/error reporting techniques too.
